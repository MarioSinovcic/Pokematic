# Pokematic
Pokematic is a web application that fosters team collaboration and is designed to be a tool that rewards teams through “gamifying” team achievements. As teams complete tasks and gain achievements and milestones, the tool rewards teams with randomly generated Pokemon or Pokemon-based items. These rewards are added into a collective Pokédex within each team, where members of the team can view their achievements and track the progress of their incoming goals.
